# Assignment-2-
Breakout Game made for Object Orientated Programming Assignment 2 through Processing

The player is greeted with a menu that allows you to choose between 3 modes. The game starts and the player must move the paddle using the mouse to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. The ball will bounce if it hits the paddle and make the blocks dissappear. You get 5 points for every block you hit and 7 lives to complete the game. The game remembers a highscore value which is stored in a text file.
